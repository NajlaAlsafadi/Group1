# Group1

The system is based on a set of four components/EPICS that when combined provide operations in a retail outlet. The type of retail outlet is unspecified, so at every stage it should be possible to
customise the system e.g., the items that the shop sells, or the sizes of box that the
shop uses. All Components have a high priority i.e., no priority Specified.
